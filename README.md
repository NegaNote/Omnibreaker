The Omni-breaker
=======

The Omni-breaker is a mod that adds an item of the same name, which can break any block instantly!
It can also break blocks on right-click, in which case it adds the drops directly to your inventory.

It uses forge energy by default (can be turned off), and the amount of energy it can store and that it uses per broken
block is configurable.

Note that the omni-breaker does NOT have a recipe provided for it; packmakers should add one themselves.

This is a standalone version of the same feature provided in the GregTech Modern addon [GregTech Modern Utilities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-modern-utilities).
If you are creating or using a GregTech Modern modpack, please use that mod instead.

This mod is licensed as MIT. Feel free to use it in whatever capacity you like.
